# This manual will not be needed
This is because Github has it's own manuals which are better and more detailed. 

These manuals are: 

## [Git cheat Sheets](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

## [GitHub Flow guide](https://enterprise.github.com/downloads/en/github-flow-cheatsheet.pdf)

## [GitHub-Flavored Markdown guide](https://enterprise.github.com/downloads/en/markdown-cheatsheet.pdf)

Which were taken from: 

## [This site](https://education.github.community/t/shopping-bags-get-a-github-swag-bag-for-your-classroom/33)

There is more information in this site: 

## https://education.github.community/

Remember that if you are a professor or a teacher, you can have a Premium account.

My own *OLD* manual will be [here](OwnManual.md)
